## Cloning the GitHub Repository

To clone this GitHub repository to your local machine on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command. For example:

```bash
cd path\to\desired\directory
```

3. Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gtdang/saugatucket-fish-passage.git
```

4. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the cloned repository directory:

```bash
cd repository-name
```

## Creating a Python Environment

This repository contains a `.tool-versions` file and a `requirements.txt` file to manage the Python environment using `pyenv` and `pip`. Follow these steps to create a Python environment on Windows:

1. Ensure you have `pyenv-win` installed on your system. If not, follow installation instructions [pyenv-win GitHub](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/blob/master/docs/installation.md#installation).
    2. If you have any problems running pyenv commands, follow the [Add System Settings](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/blob/master/docs/installation.md#add-system-settings) 
   directions to update your environment and system variables. 

2. Once `pyenv-win` is installed, navigate to the cloned repository directory in Command Prompt or PowerShell.

3. Use the following command to set up the Python version specified in the `.tool-versions` file:

```bash
pyenv install $(type .tool-versions)
```

This will install the Python version specified in the `.tool-versions` file if it's not already installed on your system.

4. After installing the required Python version, use the following command to create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv $(type .tool-versions) <environment-name>
```

Replace `<environment-name>` with the desired name for your virtual environment.

5. Activate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
pyenv local <environment-name>
```

6. Finally, install the Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you have successfully created a Python environment and installed the required dependencies for this repository on Windows.
